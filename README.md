# Reading Notes

This page will serve as a source for reading notes for the DeltaV 401 Software Development program.
The materials covered will prepare me to:

- Build and contribute to web applications, using an architecture and framework that promotes maintainability, scalability, and collaboration. These skills will be fully demonstrated during project weeks through their team development of a prototype, adhering to industry best practices and patterns.
- Apply and learn about the agile methodology by writing user stories, estimating project hours, and meeting deadlines through pre-set milestones within multiple sprints. These skills will be fully demonstrated through an iterative project in the second half of the course as students work with a partner as they plan and build towards a final deliverable.
- Apply Computer Science fundamentals when analyzing the trade-offs between competing solutions when choosing data structures and algorithms, through daily whiteboard challenges to be prepared for technical interviews.
- Participate in a series of career development workshops to build a network, establish a clean online presence, polish a resume, and establish other professional skills.
- Follow industry-standard collaborative development practices to completing a large project in week-long sprints, utilizing agile techniques such as user story construction, proper git-flow with a Kanban board, peer reviews, and individual retrospectives.
- Be ready to conduct a successful job search and obtain a job as a .NET, Full-Stack or Front-End Web Developer.
